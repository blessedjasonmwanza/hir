#HIR 
> HIR is a solution to common issues and problems faced by Nkwashi Hackers In Residence students.
> I am developing this automation solution as a way to help mitigate and/or create an organized schema/way of how hackers report and communicate their requests/issues to staff members.

**Current Inspirational Issues**
- Budgets (Currently, we have no organized way to keep track of most common bought items and/or food)
- Time ambiguities regarding bus and vehicle pickups
- canoe delay due to limited number of available canoes (This is an assumed problem that is likely to be occurring when more visitors start visiting the Dam)
- _more issues will be added as I observe the environment_
